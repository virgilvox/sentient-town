MAP PLACEHOLDER INFORMATION
============================

This directory should contain a map.png file that serves as the background for the town simulation.

Recommended specifications:
- Dimensions: 800x600 pixels (or larger, maintaining 4:3 aspect ratio)
- Style: Pixel art or simple 2D top-down view
- Color palette: Earthy, whimsical tones matching the literary tone of the simulation

The map should include visual representations of the zones defined in zones.json:
- Rose's Florist (around coordinates 10,12)
- Moonrise Bakery (around coordinates 25,30) 
- Griff's Workshop (around coordinates 45,20)
- Town Hall (around coordinates 32,15)
- Old Orchard (around coordinates 52,36)
- Main Street (connecting the key areas)

Additional elements to consider:
- Paths and roads connecting different areas
- Trees, gardens, and natural elements
- Small details that add character to the town
- A grid-friendly layout that works well with the coordinate system

For development purposes, a simple colored background with basic shapes 
representing different zones will suffice until a proper pixel art map is created.
