The ideas we've discussed have ignited a fire within me. I believe that by pooling our expertise and channeling our shared passion for this community, we can create something truly special. Let's waste no time in turning this vision into a reality. Perhaps we could start by hosting a series of seasonal workshops - where we gather herbs and flowers together, learn about their properties, and then return to the bakery to incorporate them into nourishing breads, teas, and other treats. Rose, your knowledge of flower folklore would add such a beautiful layer of storytelling to these gatherings. And Alice, the greenhouse idea is brilliant - a living laboratory where coffee plants, medicinal herbs, and edible blooms can flourish side by side.
