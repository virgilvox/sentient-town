MeadowLoop AI Town Simulation PRD

Overview:
MeadowLoop is a pixel-art AI-driven town simulation where autonomous characters interact, move, converse, and evolve. The system uses Claude/OpenAI APIs for character reasoning, conversation, and asset generation. The user can control simulation speed, inject scenarios, edit characters/zones, and view logs through a modern Vue 3 UI.

Core Features:
- Simulation engine with tick-based orchestration
- AI-driven character actions, movement, and conversations
- Memory and event management for evolving character state
- Dynamic zone and pathfinding system (walkable/unwalkable)
- Asset management for sprites, maps, and music
- Music player with theme-based track selection
- UI panels for control, editing, introspection, events, conversations, and settings
- Scenario injection system for user-driven events

Key Requirements:
1. Characters must move, speak, and interact naturally, with multi-turn conversations and memory.
2. Conversations and events must be logged and visible in the UI.
3. Zones must support walkable/unwalkable logic for pathfinding.
4. Music player must play real audio files from public/audio and handle errors gracefully.
5. All user-facing controls (start/stop, speed, scenario injection, etc.) must work reliably.
6. Asset generation and management must be robust and user-friendly.
7. The system must be resilient to API errors and provide clear feedback.

Non-Goals:
- No multiplayer or networked play
- No advanced 3D rendering
- No explicit scripting of character behavior (all AI-driven)
