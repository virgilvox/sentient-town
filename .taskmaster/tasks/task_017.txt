# Task ID: 17
# Title: Simulation Loop Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 16, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the core simulation loop that drives character AI decisions
# Details:
Implement timer-based loop that evaluates each character via Claude, processes responses, updates positions/conversations, and triggers events

# Test Strategy:
Test simulation loop with multiple characters and verify smooth operation at different speeds
